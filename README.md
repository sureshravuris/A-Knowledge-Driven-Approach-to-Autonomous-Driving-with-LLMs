In this assignment, you are required to conduct a thorough review and analysis of a topic within the realm of Large Language Models or Foundation Models. This involves selecting a specific area of focus, such as tabular, graph, or time-series foundation models. Your primary objective is to explore this area in depth, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current advancements and insights in the field. The basis of your review should be scholarly papers written in the second half of 2023 or in 2024, with a preference for survey papers or those accepted at significant conferences like NIPS 2023, ICML 2024, or ICLR 2024. It is crucial that your work is original and authentic, avoiding any form of plagiarism or auto-generation, as it will be verified using tools like TurnItIn.

## Expected Assignment Deliverables
1. **Research Paper Summary:** Rewrite the summary of your chosen paper in your own words, including a personal analysis. Utilize resources such as arXiv and Google Scholar for your research.

2. **Medium Article:** Publish an article on Medium that encapsulates the core ideas of your topic. Focus on architecture, ablation studies, and metrics, and enrich your article with visuals and personal insights. Avoid deep technical jargon and ensure the article is written from scratch.

3. **Peer Review:** Have your work reviewed by a teammate. This review should ensure the clarity and comprehensibility of your content, and feedback should be incorporated. Reference the original paper in your Medium article.

4. **YouTube Video:** Create a YouTube video (15-25 minutes long) that explains your topic in detail, goes over the paper that you created, and provides a presentation of the slides. This video should be accessible and shareable, providing a comprehensive overview of the paper and its findings. Include a link to your Medium article in the video description.

5. **GitHub Repository:** Create a public GitHub directory for your assignment, including a README.md file.
